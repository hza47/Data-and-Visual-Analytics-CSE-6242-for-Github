_Note: This project involves getting data ready for analysis and doing some preliminary investigations. Project 2 will involve modeling and predictions on the same dataset, and will be released at a later date. Both projects will have equal weightage towards your grade. You may reuse some of the preprocessing/analysis steps from Project 1 in Project 2._

# Data

In this project, you will explore a dataset that contains information about movies, including ratings, budget, gross revenue and other attributes. It was prepared by Dr. Guy Lebanon, and here is his description of the dataset:

> The file [`movies_merged`](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/gt-cs6242/project/movies_merged) contains a dataframe with the same name that has 40K rows and 39 columns. Each row represents a movie title and each column represents a descriptor such as `Title`, `Actors`, and `Budget`. I collected the data by querying IMDB API (see [www.omdbapi.com](http://www.omdbapi.com/)) and joining it with a separate dataset of movie budgets and gross earnings (unknown to you). The join key was the movie title. This data is available for personal use, but IMDbs terms of service do not allow it to be used for commercial purposes or for creating a competing repository.

# Objective

Your goal is to investigate the relationship between the movie descriptors and the box office success of movies, as represented by the variable `Gross`. This task is extremely important as it can help a studio decide which titles to fund for production, how much to bid on produced movies, when to release a title, how much to invest in marketing and PR, etc. This information is most useful before a title is released, but it is still very valuable after the movie is already released to the public (for example it can affect additional marketing spend or how much a studio should negotiate with on-demand streaming companies for a second window streaming rights).

# Instructions

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. Open this file in RStudio to get started.

When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
x = 1:10
print(x^2)
```

Plots appear inline too:
```{r}
plot(x, x^2, 'o')
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*. Enter some R code and run it.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

Please complete all the tasks below by implementing code chunks that have a `TODO` comment in them, running all code chunks so that output and plots are displayed, and typing in answers to each question (**Q:** ...) next to/below the corresponding answer prompt (**A:**). Feel free to add code chunks/show additional output to support any of the answers.

When you are done, you will need to submit the final R markdown file (as **pr1.Rmd**) with all code chunks implemented and executed, and all text responses written in. You also need to submit a PDF export of the markdown file (as **pr1.pdf**), which should show your code, output, plots and written responses--this will be your project report. Compress these two files into a single .zip archive and upload it on T-Square.

# Setup

## Load data

Make sure you've downloaded the [`movies_merged`](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/gt-cs6242/project/movies_merged) file and it is in the current working directory. Now load it into memory:

```{r}
load('movies_merged')
cat("Dataset has", dim(movies_merged)[1], "rows and", dim(movies_merged)[2], "columns", end="\n", file="")
```

This creates an object of the same name (`movies_merged`). For convenience, you can copy it to `df` and start using it:

```{r}
df = movies_merged
cat("Column names:", end="\n", file="")
colnames(df)
```

## Load R packages

Load any R packages that you will need to use. You can come back to this chunk, edit it and re-run to load any additional packages later.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(proto)
library(GGally)
library(gsubfn)
library(reshape)

```

If you are loading any non-standard packages (ones that have not been discussed in class or explicitly allowed for this project), please mention them below. Include any special instructions if they cannot be installed using the regular `install.packages('<pkg name>')` command.

**Non-standard packages used**: 
install.packages('gsubfn')
install.packages('reshape')


# Tasks

Each task below is worth **10** points, and is meant to be performed sequentially, i.e. do step 2 after you have processed the data as described in step 1. Total points: **100**

Complete each task by implementing code chunks as described by `TODO` comments, and by responding to questions ("**Q**:") with written answers ("**A**:"). If you are unable to find a meaningful or strong relationship in any of the cases when requested, explain why not by referring to appropriate plots/statistics.

It is okay to handle missing values below by omission, but please omit as little as possible. It is worthwhile to invest in reusable and clear code as you may need to use it or modify it in project 2.

## 1. Remove non-movie rows

The variable `Type` captures whether the row is a movie, a TV series, or a game. Remove all rows from `df` that do not correspond to movies.

```{r}
# TODO: Remove all rows from df that do not correspond to movies
df2 <- df[df$Type == "movie",]
dim(df2)
```

**Q**: How many rows are left after removal? _Enter your response below._

**A**: 40000

## 2. Process `Runtime` column

The variable `Runtime` represents the length of the title as a string. Write R code to convert it to a numeric value (in minutes) and replace `df$Runtime` with the new numeric column.

```{r}
# TODO: Replace df$Runtime with a numeric column containing the runtime in minutes

#Omit the rows that have NA
df2 = df2[!is.na(df2$Runtime) & df2$Runtime != "N/A",]
df2$Runtime <- as.character(df2$Runtime)

# Change each value on df2 to integer, of course after conversion to minutes.
n = length(df2$Runtime)
n_seq=seq(1, n)
for (i in n_seq)
{
  split_val = strsplit(df2$Runtime[i],"\\s+")[[1]]

  if (length(split_val) == 2)
  {
    if (split_val[2] == "min") {df2$Runtime[i] = suppressWarnings(as.integer(split_val[1]))}
    if (split_val[2] == "h")   {df2$Runtime[i] = (suppressWarnings(as.integer(split_val[1])) *
    60) + (suppressWarnings(as.integer(split_val[3])))}
  }

  if (length(split_val) == 4)
  {
    if ((split_val[2] == "h") &&  (split_val[4] == "min"))  
    {df2$Runtime[i] = (as.integer(split_val[1]) * 60) + (as.integer(split_val[3]))}
  }
}
```

Now investigate the distribution of `Runtime` values and how it changes over years (variable `Year`, which you can bucket into decades) and in relation to the budget (variable `Budget`). Include any plots that illustrate.

```{r}
# TODO: Investigate the distribution of Runtime values and how it varies by Year and Budget

#Convert Runtime column from type character to type numeric
df2$Runtime <- as.numeric(as.character(df2$Runtime))

#Store the mean run time of movies by year in the dataframe mean_runtime_by_year
mean_runtime_by_year <- aggregate(Runtime~Year, df2, mean)

#qplot(mean_runtime_by_year$Year, mean_runtime_by_year$Runtime, geom = c("line", "point")) # Line and Point plot
smoothing = smooth.spline(mean_runtime_by_year$Year, mean_runtime_by_year$Runtime, spar=1.0)
plot(mean_runtime_by_year$Year, mean_runtime_by_year$Runtime, xlab = "Year", ylab = "Mean Runtime", main = "Mean Runtime Trend with Year")
lines(smoothing)

#Define decades
n = length(df2$Year)
n_seq=seq(1, n)
for (i in n_seq)
{
  if((df2$Year[i] >= 1880) && (df2$Year[i] < 1890)) {df2$decade[i] = "1880-1889"}
  if((df2$Year[i] >= 1890) && (df2$Year[i] < 1900)) {df2$decade[i] = "1890-1899"}
  if((df2$Year[i] >= 1900) && (df2$Year[i] < 1910)) {df2$decade[i] = "1900-1909"}
  if((df2$Year[i] >= 1910) && (df2$Year[i] < 1920)) {df2$decade[i] = "1910-1919"}
  if((df2$Year[i] >= 1920) && (df2$Year[i] < 1930)) {df2$decade[i] = "1920-1929"}
  if((df2$Year[i] >= 1930) && (df2$Year[i] < 1940)) {df2$decade[i] = "1930-1939"}
  if((df2$Year[i] >= 1940) && (df2$Year[i] < 1950)) {df2$decade[i] = "1940-1949"}
  if((df2$Year[i] >= 1950) && (df2$Year[i] < 1960)) {df2$decade[i] = "1950-1959"}
  if((df2$Year[i] >= 1960) && (df2$Year[i] < 1970)) {df2$decade[i] = "1960-1969"}
  if((df2$Year[i] >= 1970) && (df2$Year[i] < 1980)) {df2$decade[i] = "1970-1979"}
  if((df2$Year[i] >= 1980) && (df2$Year[i] < 1990)) {df2$decade[i] = "1980-1989"}
  if((df2$Year[i] >= 1990) && (df2$Year[i] < 2000)) {df2$decade[i] = "1990-1999"}
  if((df2$Year[i] >= 2000) && (df2$Year[i] < 2010)) {df2$decade[i] = "2000-2009"}
  if(df2$Year[i] >= 2010) {df2$decade[i] = "2010-2018"}
}

mean_runtime_by_decade <- aggregate(Runtime~decade, df2, mean)

#Plot Decade vs Runtime
qplot(x = mean_runtime_by_decade$decade, y = mean_runtime_by_decade$Runtime, data = mean_runtime_by_decade, 
      xlab = "Decades", ylab = "Mean Runtime", main = "Mean Runtime Trend with Decade") + coord_flip()

#Create a new data framw df3 in which we will keep only those rows for which we have a budget available
df3 = df2[df2$Budget != "N/A" & !is.na(df2$Budget),]

#Here I am creating 4 bins. First bin has all the values of Budget in the first 35%ile. 
#The second bin has all the values between 35th to 60th percentile. 
#Third bin contains the values between 60 to 80 percentile
#Fourth bin contains the values between 80 to 100 percentile

budget_bins = quantile(df3$Budget, c(.35, .60, .80))

#Now lets bucketize the Budgets. Low budget movies 
n = length(df3$Budget)
n_seq=seq(1, n)
for (i in n_seq)
{
  if (df3$Budget[i]  <  budget_bins[[1]]) 
  {df3$BudgetBin[i] = "1. Low"}
  
  if ((df3$Budget[i] >= budget_bins[[1]]) && (df3$Budget<budget_bins[[2]])) 
  {df3$BudgetBin[i] = "2. Medium"}
  
  if ((df3$Budget[i] >= budget_bins[[2]]) && (df3$Budget<budget_bins[[3]])) 
  {df3$BudgetBin[i] = "3. High"}
  
  if (df3$Budget[i]  >= budget_bins[[3]]) 
  {df3$BudgetBin[i] = "4. Very High"}
 }

mean_runtime_by_Budget <- aggregate(Runtime~BudgetBin, df3, mean)
mean_runtime_by_Budget <- mean_runtime_by_Budget[order(mean_runtime_by_Budget$Runtime),] 

qplot(x = mean_runtime_by_Budget$BudgetBin, 
      y = mean_runtime_by_Budget$Runtime, data = mean_runtime_by_Budget, 
      main = "Budget vs Run time Relation", xlab = "Budget", ylab = "Mean Run Time")

```

_Feel free to insert additional code chunks as necessary._

**Q**: Comment on the distribution as well as relationships. Are there any patterns or trends that you can observe?

**A**: In the year vs run time trend chart, We can clearly notice that the run times have increased over the last century and are asymptotically saturating. We see a sudden increase in the mean movie runtime from the 1900-1910s decade to the 1910-1920s decade. Another interesting finding is that the average movie runtimes decreased from the 1980-1990s decade till the 2000-2010s decade but has gone up in the 2010-2020s decade. It seems that the average run times will saturate somewhere around 100 mins. The relationship between year and mean run time is asymptotic and seems to saturate now. As far as the trend of budget vs run time is concerned, we see that the budget of the movie positively correlates with the average run time. This means that in general high budget movies have higher runtimes. The relationship is somewhat linear. This was not very evident when I plotted a scatter plot of budget vs runtime, but when i bucketized budget and plotted the average runtimes per budget, then I could clearly see a trend as shown in the graph.

## 3. Encode `Genre` column

The column `Genre` represents a list of genres associated with the movie in a string format. Write code to parse each text string into a binary vector with 1s representing the presence of a genre and 0s the absence, and add it to the dataframe as additional columns. Then remove the original `Genre` column.

For example, if there are a total of 3 genres: Drama, Comedy, and Action, a movie that is both Action and Comedy should be represented by a binary vector <0, 1, 1>. Note that you need to first compile a dictionary of all possible genres and then figure out which movie has which genres (you can use the R `tm` package to create the dictionary).

```{r}
# TODO: Replace Genre with a collection of binary columns

df_genre <- unlist(strsplit(df2$Genre, ','))

# Change every thing to lowercase
df_genre <- tolower(df_genre)
df2$Genre <- tolower(df2$Genre)

# Remove spaces from genre
df_genre <- gsub(' ', '', df_genre)
df2$Genre <- gsub(' ', '', df2$Genre)

# lets make a unqiue list of genre values.
df_genre_unique <- unique(df_genre)

#Count the number of rows and columns in df2
number_of_rows_in_df2 = nrow(df2)
number_of_cols_in_df_genre = length(df_genre_unique)

#Create a new dataframe that will only tsore binary values for all genres and initialize the dataframe with 0
genre_binary_df=data.frame(matrix(nrow=number_of_rows_in_df2, ncol=number_of_cols_in_df_genre))
colnames(genre_binary_df)=df_genre_unique
genre_binary_df[,]=0

#Check every value in the unique dataframe exists in the Genre column or not.
for(input in df_genre_unique)
{
 genre_binary_df[grep(input,df2[,"Genre"]),input] = 1
}

#Attach the binary columns to df2
df2 = cbind(df2, genre_binary_df)

#Remove the column "Genre" from the dataframe.
df2 = subset(df2, select = -c(Genre))

```

Plot the relative proportions of movies having the top 10 most common genres.

```{r}
# TODO: Select movies from top 10 most common genres and plot their relative proportions
#Sum each of the columns that have binary value for genres.
count_of_movies_per_genre <- data.frame(genre = names(genre_binary_df),num_movies=colSums(genre_binary_df))
count_of_movies_per_genre$ratio <- (count_of_movies_per_genre$num_movies/number_of_rows_in_df2) * 100

#Descending order
count_of_movies_per_genre <- count_of_movies_per_genre[order(-count_of_movies_per_genre$ratio),]

#Plot a bar graph representing the percenage contribution of each genre in the top 10 genres.
ggplot(count_of_movies_per_genre[1:10,], aes(x=reorder(genre, -ratio), y=ratio)) + 
geom_bar(stat="identity") + scale_y_continuous() + labs(x="Top 10 Genres", y="Percentage") + 
ggtitle("Relative proportions of movies having the top 10 most common genres")

```

Examine how the distribution of `Runtime` changes across genres for the top 10 most common genres.

```{r}
# TODO: Plot Runtime distribution for top 10 most common genres
df4 <- count_of_movies_per_genre[1:10,1]
for (i in df4)
{
i_val <- df2[df2[[i]]==1,c('Title','Runtime')]
i_val$genre = i
df4 <- rbind(df4, i_val)
}

df4 <- merge(df4, count_of_movies_per_genre[,c('genre','ratio')],by='genre')
df4$Runtime <- as.numeric(as.character(df4$Runtime))
ggplot(df4, aes(genre, Runtime)) + geom_boxplot() + coord_flip() +
labs(x='Genre',y='Runtime',title='Box plot distribution of runtime by Genre for top 10 Genres')
```

**Q**: Describe the interesting relationship(s) you observe. Are there any expected or unexpected trends that are evident?

**A**: 
Expected results: Average runtime of short movies is expected to be less and it is actually less as can be seen from the box plot.
Unexpected results: Animation movies surprisingly have a short runtime. infact, the median of animation movies is even lesser than the median of short movies. This was very unexpected result. The median runtimes of other genres is very similar. The genre "Documentary" has a very high variance and the maximum runtime of a movie is from the Genre "Documentary" and is 873 mins. The genres have a longer tail at the higher side.

## 4. Eliminate mismatched rows

The dataframe was put together by merging two different sources of data and it is possible that the merging process was inaccurate in some cases (the merge was done based on movie title, but there are cases of different movies with the same title). There are 3 columns that contain date information: `Year` (numeric year), `Date` (numeric year), and `Released` (string representation of the release date).

Find and remove all rows where you suspect a merge error occurred based on a mismatch between these variables. To make sure subsequent analysis and modeling work well, avoid removing more than 10% of the rows that have a `Gross` value present.

_Note: Do not remove the rows with `Gross == NA` at this point, just use this a guideline._

```{r}
# TODO: Remove rows with Year/Date/Released mismatch

#get Year from year released
df2$year_from_year_released = as.numeric(format(as.Date(df2$Released, format = "%Y-%m-%d"), "%Y"))

#For data to not get filtered out and discared because of date mismatch, one or more of the following 
#9 conditions need to be followed.          

#Condition0 - 
#Gross column is NA:The instructions in the question ask us to not remove rows with 'Gross == NA'

#Condition1 & 2
#((is.na(df2$Year)) & (is.na(df2$Date)))

#Condition3
#((is.na(df2$Year)) & (is.na(df2$year_from_year_released)))

#Condition4
#((is.na(df2$Year)) & (!is.na(df2$Date)) & (!is.na(df2$year_from_year_released)) 
# & (df2$Date == df2$year_from_year_released))

#Condition5
#((is.na(df2$Date)) & (is.na(df2$year_from_year_released)))

#Condition6
#((is.na(df2$Date)) & (!is.na(df2$Year)) & (!is.na(df2$year_from_year_released)) & 
#(df2$Year == df2$year_from_year_released))

#Condition7
#((is.na(df2$year_from_year_released)) & (!is.na(df2$Year)) & (!is.na(df2$Date)) & (df2$Year == df2$Date))

#Condition8
#((!is.na(df2$Year)) & (!is.na(df2$Date)) & (!is.na(df2$year_from_year_released)) 
#& (df2$Year == df2$Date) & (df2$Year == df2$year_from_year_released))

#All the above 8 conditions are given below.
temp <- df2[((is.na(df2$Gross)) | ((is.na(df2$Year)) & (is.na(df2$Date))) | ((is.na(df2$Year)) & 
        (is.na(df2$year_from_year_released))) | ((is.na(df2$Year)) & (!is.na(df2$Date)) & 
        (!is.na(df2$year_from_year_released)) & (df2$Date == df2$year_from_year_released)) | 
        ((is.na(df2$Date)) & (is.na(df2$year_from_year_released))) | ((is.na(df2$Date)) 
        & (!is.na(df2$Year)) & (!is.na(df2$year_from_year_released)) & 
        (df2$Year == df2$year_from_year_released)) | ((is.na(df2$year_from_year_released)) & 
        (!is.na(df2$Year)) & (!is.na(df2$Date)) & (df2$Year == df2$Date)) | 
        ((!is.na(df2$Year)) & (!is.na(df2$Date)) & (!is.na(df2$year_from_year_released)) 
        & (df2$Year == df2$Date) & (df2$Year == df2$year_from_year_released))) ,]

#Filtered dataframe.
df2 = temp

#Number of rows in filtered dataframe
rows_in_resultant_df = nrow(df2)

print ("Rows remaining in the resulting dataset is")
print (rows_in_resultant_df)

```

**Q**: What is your precise removal logic, and how many rows remain in the resulting dataset?

**A**: The logic used is that any case that has NA in "Gross" column makes it to the resultant data set as required by the problem statement. The problesm statement clearly asks us to not remove the rows with Gross==NA. Also, on top of that, only those cases make it to the resultant dataset in which Year Date and Released columns match. In some cases not all the 3 values (Year, Date and Released) are populated. The logic also takes care of those case in which only 1 of the 3 columns are populated and other 2 are NA and also those cases in which 2 of the 3 columns are populated and only 1 is NA and those cases in which all 3 columns are populated. So in summary, all the dates that are present in those 3 columns should exactly be the same unless the columns are populated with NA.

38247 rows remain in the resulting dataset.

## 5. Explore `Gross` revenue

For the commercial success of a movie, production houses want to maximize Gross revenue. Investigate if Gross revenue is related to Budget, Runtime or Genre in any way.

_Note: To get a meaningful relationship, you may have to partition the movies into subsets such as short vs. long duration, or by genre, etc._

```{r}
# TODO: Investigate if Gross Revenue is related to Budget, Runtime or Genre

#1. Investigation of gross revenue variation with budget.
qplot(x = df2$Budget, y = df2$Gross, data = df2, main = "Gross Revenue vs Budget",

print ("Correlation table of correlation between gross revenue vs runtime (split by Genres).")
print(corr_of_genre_runtime)


#3. Gross revenue by Genre
#First create a new datframe which has revnue and that is expanded by genre.

grenre_gross_df <- data.frame(x = character(), y = numeric())
colnames(grenre_gross_df) <- c("Genre", "Gross")

     grenre_gross_df <- rbind(grenre_gross_df, temp) 
    }
 }
}
grenre_gross_df <- grenre_gross_df[(!is.na(grenre_gross_df$Gross)),]
grenre_gross_df$Gross = as.numeric(grenre_gross_df$Gross)

ggplot(grenre_gross_df, aes(x=Genre, y=Gross)) + geom_boxplot() + coord_flip() + 
  labs(x="Genre", y="Gross Revenue", title="Gross Revenue vs Genre")

```

**Q**: Did you find any observable relationships or combinations of Budget/Runtime/Genre that result in high Gross revenue? If you divided the movies into different subsets, you may get different answers for them - point out interesting ones.

**A**: 
1. Gross Revenue vs Budget. 
A good correlation is seen between gross revenue and Budget. Higher the budget of the movie, higher is the gross revenue. The correlation is 0.733 which is pretty strong. This is visible even better in the log log plot. Another inference that can be conclusively drawn from the log log plot is that the correlation is even better for movies that have a higher budget.

2. Gross Revenue vs Runtime
The correlation between gross revenue and runtime is weak and stands at 0.263. Since we see a poor correlation between Gross revenue and runtime, we want to drill down further and see if there is a genre for which the correlation is better. We found that horror and action movies have a somewhat better correlation between revenue and runtime but it still isnt that strong.

3. Gross Revenue vs Genre
Animation, Adventure, action, sci-fi, fantasy and family movies have high median gross revenues when compared with other genres. On the other hand musical and documentary movies have the lowest median gross revenue. Also, most of the movies have outliers on the higher side of gross revnue which means that the data is positively skewed.


```{r}
# TODO: Investigate if Gross Revenue is related to Release Month
#Create a new columns for the release month

## 6. Process `Awards` column

The variable `Awards` describes nominations and awards in text format. Convert it to 2 numeric columns, the first capturing the number of wins, and the second capturing nominations. Replace the `Awards` column with these new columns, and then study the relationship of `Gross` revenue with respect to them.

_Note: The format of the `Awards` column is not standard; you may have to use regular expressions to find the relevant values. Try your best to process them, and you may leave the ones that don't have enough information as NAs or set them to 0s._

```{r}
# TODO: Convert Awards to 2 numeric columns: wins and nominations

# Change all the characters to lowercase
df2$awards_lc = tolower(df2$Awards)

# extract wins and nominations
df2$wins1 <- strapplyc(df2$awards_lc,"([0-9]+)\\s*win")
df2$nominations1 <- strapplyc(df2$awards_lc,"([0-9]+)\\s*nominat")

df2$wins2 <- strapplyc(df2$awards_lc,"on\\s*([0-9]+)")
df2$nominations2 <- strapplyc(df2$awards_lc,"ominated for\\s*([0-9]+)")

df2$wins1 <- suppressWarnings(as.numeric(df2$wins1))
df2$wins2 <- suppressWarnings(as.numeric(df2$wins2))
df2$nominations1 <- suppressWarnings(as.numeric(df2$nominations1))
df2$nominations2 <- suppressWarnings(as.numeric(df2$nominations2))

df2$wins <- rowSums(df2[,c("wins1", "wins2")], na.rm=TRUE)
df2$nominations <- rowSums(df2[,c("nominations1", "nominations2")], na.rm=TRUE)
is.na(df2$wins) <- !df2$wins
is.na(df2$nominations) <- !df2$nominations

df2$winsandnom <- rowSums(df2[,c("wins", "nominations")], na.rm=TRUE)


#convert it into numeric
df2$wins <- as.numeric(df2$wins)
df2$nominations <- as.numeric(df2$nominations)

#Remove the column "Awards" from the dataframe.
df2 = subset(df2, select = -c(Awards))

#Remove other columns created for intermediate calculations.
df2 = subset(df2, select = -c(wins1,wins2,nominations1,nominations2,awards_lc))


print (c(("Number of rows that have a valid value for wins - "),(nrow(subset(df2, (!is.na(df2$wins)))))))
print (c(("Number of rows that have a valid value for nominations - "),(nrow(subset(df2, (!is.na(df2$nominations)))))))
print (c(("Number of rows that have a valid value for either wins or nominations - "), nrow(subset(df2, ((!is.na(df2$wins))|(!is.na(df2$nominations)))))))



```

**Q**: How did you construct your conversion mechanism? How many rows had valid/non-zero wins or nominations?

**A**: I used strapplyc function from the package "gsubfn". I first change the characters in the column "Awards" to lowercase.
For number of wins I grab the digits that follow the string 'won' and preceed the string 'win' and add them up for every row in the dataframe. 
For number of nominations I grab the digits that follow the string 'nominated for' and preceed the string 'nomination' and add them up for every row in the dataframe. This way, I pretty much cover all the cases.
Once I do that I remove the awards column from the data frame 'df2'.

Results:
Number of rows that have a valid value for wins - 10909                                             
Number of rows that have a valid value for nominations - 11383                                              
Number of rows that have a valid value for either wins or nominations - 14667

print ("Correlation factor of Gross Revenue and Nominations")
print (corr)


```

**Q**: How does the gross revenue vary by number of awards won and nominations received?

**A**: There is a very very weak or no correlation seen between gross revenue and wins and the same is true for gross revenue and nominations. The correlation coefficient is higher for correlation between gross revenue and nominations but is still weak. 

## 7. Movie ratings from IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes

There are several variables that describe ratings, including IMDb ratings (`imdbRating` represents average user ratings and `imdbVotes` represents the number of user ratings), and multiple Rotten Tomatoes ratings (represented by several variables pre-fixed by `tomato`). Read up on such ratings on the web (for example [rottentomatoes.com/about](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/about) and [ www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?votestopfaq](http:// www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?votestopfaq)).

Investigate the pairwise relationships between these different descriptors using graphs.

```{r}
# TODO: Illustrate how ratings from IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes are related
ggpairs(df2[, c("imdbVotes","imdbRating","tomatoMeter", "tomatoRating", "tomatoReviews")], 
        title = "Relationship between IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes Ratings")

dfr <- data.frame(df2$imdbRating,df2$tomatoMeter/10)
dfr <-dfr[complete.cases(dfr),]
ggplot(melt(dfr),aes(x=value, fill=variable)) +
ggtitle("Density Plot of Imdb Rating Vs Tomato Meter") +
geom_density(alpha=0.7)



```

**Q**: Comment on the similarities and differences between the user ratings of IMDb and the critics ratings of Rotten Tomatoes.

**A**: The user ratings of IMDB and critic rating of rotten tomatoes (tomatometer) correlate really well. We see a high corrleation of 0.749. Intuititvely this makes sense and one would expect the critic ratings and user ratings to correlate well. I scale down TomatoMeter rating to a scale of 10 since it is on a scale of 100. I do this to compare the spread of values on TomatorMeter and on IMDB. We can clearly see that the density plot of values on Tomato meter is wider than the density plot of IMDB ratings.

Other Findings:
We also see a strong correlation between tomato rating and tomato meter. We also see a very good correlation between IMDB Ratings and Tomato Ratings. Intuitively this makes sense and this is what I had expected. Inspite of IMDB and Tomato being 2 different companies, the ratings correlate pretty well. One thing worth noting is that the spread of rating values is more in tomato and the spread of rating values is less in IMDB. This is strange and it means that typical IMDB ratings are more within a specific range and the standard deviation is less. We also see a very high corrleation between tomato Rating and Tomato meter. 

## 8. Ratings and awards

These ratings typically reflect the general appeal of the movie to the public or gather opinions from a larger body of critics. Whereas awards are given by professional societies that may evaluate a movie on specific attributes, such as artistic performance, screenplay, sound design, etc.

Study the relationship between ratings and awards using graphs (awards here refers to wins and/or nominations). 

```{r}
# TODO: Show how ratings and awards are related

#Plot IMDB ratings vs Wins
qplot(x = imdbRating, y = wins, data = df2, main = "IMDB Rating vs Wins",
      xlab = "IMDB Rating", ylab = "Wins", geom = c("point", "smooth"))

#Plot IMDB ratings vs Nominations
qplot(x = imdbRating, y = nominations, data = df2, main = "IMDB Rating vs Nominations", 
      xlab = "IMDB Rating", ylab = "Nominations", geom = c("point", "smooth"))

#Plot IMDB ratings vs Wins+Nominations
qplot(x = imdbRating, y = winsandnom, data = df2, main = "IMDB Rating vs Wins+Nominations", 
      xlab = "IMDB Rating", ylab = "Wins+Nominations", geom = c("point", "smooth"))

#Plot Tomato ratings vs Wins
qplot(x = tomatoRating, y = wins, data = df2, main = "Tomato Rating vs Wins", 
      xlab = "Tomato Rating", ylab = "Wins", geom = c("point", "smooth"))

#Plot Tomato ratings vs Nominations
qplot(x = tomatoRating, y = nominations, data = df2, main = "Tomato Rating vs Nominations", 
      xlab = "Tomato Rating", ylab = "Nominations", geom = c("point", "smooth"))

#Plot Tomato ratings vs Wins+Nominations
qplot(x = tomatoRating, y = winsandnom, data = df2, main = "Tomato Rating vs Wins+Nominations", 
      xlab = "Tomato Rating", ylab = "Wins+Nominations", geom = c("point", "smooth"))

#Finding correlation between 2 variables.
corr = (cor(df2$imdbRating, df2$winsandnom, use="complete.obs", method = "pearson"))
print ("Correlation factor of IMDB Rating and Wins+Nominations")
print (corr)

corr = (cor(df2$tomatoRating, df2$winsandnom, use="complete.obs", method = "pearson"))
print ("Correlation factor of Tomato Rating and Wins+Nominations")
print (corr)

```

**Q**: How good are these ratings in terms of predicting the success of a movie in winning awards or nominations? Is there a high correlation between two variables?

**A**: We definitely see a trend in the relationship between ratings and wins/Nominations. The graphs generated above show clearly that movies that have a high rating earn most number of nominations and awards. This is true for both imdb and tomato ratings. We see that movies that have ratings in the range of 7-9 have earned the highest nominations and awards. The same holds true for Tomato Ratings as well. This relation ship is seen for Nominations and wins and the sum of nominations and wins too. When we calculate the correlation we see that although the correlation number is positive(which is expected), the magnitude of correlation is small. this is because the relationship is not linear. But the key takeaway here is that there is a trend which we clearly see in the plots.

## 9. Expected insights

Come up with two new insights (backed up by data and graphs) that is expected. Here means insights that are not an immediate consequence of one of the above tasks. You may use any of the columns already explored above or a different one in the dataset, such as `Title`, `Actors`, etc.

```{r}
# TODO: Find and illustrate two expected insights

#A. Relationship between wins and nominations
corr = (cor(df2$wins, df2$nominations, use="complete.obs", method = "pearson"))
print ("Correlation factor of correlation between wins and nominations")
print (corr)
qplot(x = nominations, y = wins, data = df2, main = "Nominations vs Wins", 
      xlab = "Nominations", ylab = "Wins", geom = c("point", "smooth"))

#B. Relationship between Gross Revenue and Domestic Gross Revenue 
corr = (cor(df2$Gross, df2$Domestic_Gross, use="complete.obs", method = "pearson"))
print ("Correlation factor of correlation between Gross Revenue and Domestic Gross")
print (corr)

#Plot of Gross Revenue and Domestic Gross Revenue 
ggplot(df2) + geom_point(aes(x=Gross,Domestic_Gross)) + 
  geom_smooth(aes(x=Gross,Domestic_Gross), method="lm") + 
  ggtitle("Gross Revenue vs Domestic Grosss") + xlab("Gross Revenue") + ylab("Domestic Gross")

```

**Q**: Expected insight #1.

**A**: 
We expect high correlation between wins and nominations. More the number of nominations more should be the number of wins.
A high correlation is seen between the number of nominations and the number of wins. The correlation is 0.81. Intuitively one would epxect this relationship between wins and nominations. This is evident by the plot as well. in earlier questions we studied the relationship between wins and awards and nominations and awards but more nominations translate to more wins. This is something we expected is proven by this graph.


**Q**: Expected insight #2.

**A**: 
We expect high correlation between Gross Revenue and Domestic Gross. if a movie has higher domestic revenue it is expected to have higher overall revenue too. A very high correlation is seen between the gross revenue and domestic gross revenue. This is intuitive too since if a movie ha a high domestic revnue, it should have a high gross revenue too. In this dataset, the correlation is 0.94 which is very very high and is expected.

## 10. Unexpected insight

Come up with one new insight (backed up by data and graphs) that is unexpected at first glance and do your best to motivate it. Same instructions apply as the previous task.

```{r}
# TODO: Find and illustrate one unexpected insight
ggplot(df2) + geom_point(aes(x=Budget,tomatoMeter)) + ggtitle("Budget vs Tomato Meter") + 
  xlab("Budget") + ylab("Tomato Meter")
corr = (cor(df2$Budget, df2$tomatoMeter, use="complete.obs", method = "pearson"))
print ("Correlation factor of correlation between Budget and Tomato Meter")
print (corr)

```

**Q**: Unexpected insight.
Relationship between movie budget and Tomato Meter


**A**: 
According to Rotten tomatoes The Tomatometer rating is based on the published opinions of hundreds of film and television critics and is a trusted measurement of movie and TV programming quality for millions of moviegoers. The Tomatometer rating represents the percentage of professional critic reviews that are positive for a given film or television show. I expected the tomatpo meter rating to somewhat correlate postitively with the movie budget. I was of the opinion that a movie which has high budget can sign better actors, directors, script writers, cinematorgraphers etc and inherently will turn out to be good movies but that doesnt seem to be the case. It tunrs out that there is no correlation whatsoever between the Tomato meter rating and the budget of the movie. The correlation factor is almost 0. Infact, it is slightly negative (-0.059).
